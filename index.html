<p>Oak Creek is a town in the Midwestern United States. The town’s population is approximately 50% Jewish.
Thousands of Oak Creek’s citizens are survivors of the Holocaust.

The National Nazi Party of America (NNPA) wishes to have a parade in Oak Creek. They would be
wearing their Nazi Party uniforms, displaying swastikas, and distributing pamphlets that would encourage
resentment of people of the Jewish faith or ancestry. The NNPA also intends on marching with posters that
promote their Christian beliefs. They applied for a permit with the town. However, a local court filed a court
order prohibiting the group from engaging in those activities (This is called an injunction).
Township officials, the local court, and a majority of the citizens in Oak Creek argue that the NNPA would
be promoting hatred with their messaging and that the displaying of the swastika constitutes fighting words
- therefore, violence would ensue.

<p>
The NNPA argues that the First Amendment grants them the right to assemble and march peacefully -
regardless of the uniforms they wear, symbols they are displaying, or pamphlets they are distributing. The
group and their lawyers threaten to file an appeal with the State Supreme Court - or Supreme Court - if
need be.

Does the NNPA have the right to march in Oak Creek? Are their First Amendment rights being restricted?
